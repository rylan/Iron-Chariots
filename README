This application is was intially designed to provide WebOS TouchPad specific experience for accessing the Iron 
Chariots Wiki found at http://wiki.ironchariots.org. With the release of EnyoJS as an open source project work 
has begun to port this project to other systems (Currently supporting BlackBerry Playbook, webOS, Android 
(ICS tablets). The Windows Phone 7 application was written from scratch for that platform, because at that time 
EnyoJS 2.0 was not ready. 

/blackberry (playbook, EnyoJS)
/Android (tablet version is stable, EnyoJS)
/webOS  (stable, EnyoJS)
/wp7    (native wp7 app)

Currently the source files are duplicated once stable versions for different systems are estiblished, we will 
place all the duplicated source to a single location and create build scripts to build the different projects. 

The Iron Chariots Wiki provides information on apologetics and counter-apologetics by collecting common arguments 
and providing responses. A goal of the site is to help counter misinformation and poor arguments which masquerade 
as evidence for religious claims. 

This project is not officially supported by IronChariots.org
